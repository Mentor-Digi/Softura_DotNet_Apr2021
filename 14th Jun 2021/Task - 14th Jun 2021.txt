Database first Approach
1. Empty Web Application with MVC Folders - Model, Controller and View
2. Create Controller - CRUD - Empty controller
                A folder gets created under view
3. Model - C# class 
4. View - No model, No Layout - Home.cshtml
5. Route.Config - CRUD\Index
6. Additional Views - Create.cshtml & Edit.cshtml
7. Configuring Model - reference to framework classes
                DataTable DisplayBooks(){}
8. COntroller -ActionResult Index()
Insert  new record into the table
9. Model - create a method to insert data- SP  to insert data
10. COntroller - Action Result for Submit Button - data from the form  and the action Button
                WE called the insert method written in the model.
                We called the Index - Home Page will be loaded.
11. View - Create.cshtml - design a form to receive input
                added submit buttons to Submit and Cancel 
                added a Form Action Method - 
12 Action Result in the controller to load Create.cshtml
13. Home page we added hyperlink to ActionResult method - insert
